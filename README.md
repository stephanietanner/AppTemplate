CapacityNotification for Rally SDK
=========================

## Overview

a.     Why the App is useful
    This app is useful to determine how your team is doing in their iterations. There are two implemented modules and more to come.
    The first module shows up if your calculated load is over 100%. This generally means you are at high risk of not finishing up 
    your tasks for the iteration. The module shows a personal task burndown when you select on the tasks owned by you in the iteration.
    You can see the ToDo values and whether or not they are staying in the same place or if you are on the right track.
    
    The second module is specifically for the project managers. It will let you know which users are at risk or above 100% calculated load, 
    or below 85%. If they are below 85, you can assign them more tasks using the grid that shows up on the screen, removing tasks from those
    that have too much work and giving tasks to those that have too little work. 
 b.     Any special configurations that the App needs to function
 
 Because real data was hard to come by we are using a fake data store for the first module.
